## Events

Events are a structured notification mechanism built on delegates. They let one part of a system signal that something happened while keeping subscribers loosely coupled.

### Design lens

Method-related features are easiest to judge from the caller’s point of view. The question is not only whether the syntax works, but whether the API feels understandable and stable.

- Start from the signature.
- Think about how callers will read and use the member.
- Prefer readability over clever syntax.

### Example

```csharp
class Alarm
{
    public event Action? Triggered;
    public void Raise() => Triggered?.Invoke();
}
```

Look at both the declaration and the call site. A method feature is only useful if it improves the relationship between those two points.

### API note

Convenient syntax should not come at the cost of a confusing API surface.

### Practice

Rewrite the example with a different method name or signature and notice how the call site changes.
